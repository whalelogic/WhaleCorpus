**A knowledge base and research environment for software engineering, AI, and the Future.**

This repository is designed to serve as a **living textbook + research archive + business strategy guide**, powered by modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The goal:  
- Educate to the **doctoral level** in **Software Engineering, Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems, and Artificial Intelligence**.  
- Provide **industry-ready software knowledge** in Go, Rust, Python, and modern systems design.  
- Capture **business strategy, small business growth, and entrepreneurship practices**.  
- Act as a **self-hosted mentor/PhD advisor in a box** — a system you can query and expand over time.
