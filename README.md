**A knowledge base and research environment for software engineering, AI, and the Future.**

This repository is designed to serve as a **living textbook + research archive + business strategy guide**, powered by modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The goal:  
- Educate to the **doctoral level** in **Software Engineering, Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems, and Artificial Intelligence**.  
- Provide **industry-ready software knowledge** in Go, Rust, Python, and modern systems design.  
- Capture **business strategy, small business growth, and entrepreneurship practices**.  
- Act as a **self-hosted mentor/PhD advisor in a box** — a system you can query and expand over time.  


## 📚 Core Topics

- **Foundations** → Algorithms, complexity, probability, optimization, security.  
- **Software Engineering** → Rust, Go, Python, architecture, design patterns, testing.  
- **Cloud & Systems** → Kubernetes, distributed storage, microservices, networking.  
- **AI & Deep Learning** → CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, LLMs, RAG, alignment.  
- **Big Data & Pipelines** → ETL, streaming, vector databases, observability.  
- **Business Strategy** → SaaS models, growth hacking, developer advocacy.  
- **Edge & IoT** → real-time inference, data synchronization, security.
